In this paper, we propose a technique to support arbitrary range distribution query on volumetric data. Our proposed technique allows answering such queries while keeping the query workload and the associated storage cost very low, regardless of data and query size. Our method adapts a data structure called integral distribution volume which is capable of fast answering such queries and proposes a suite of transformations to the data structure to allow compact storage. 
%The immediate application of our method is to allow the user to explore the statistical behavior of data at various resolutions. Also, 
Any visualization algorithm which needs distributions from different regions benefits from this technique. 

The proposed technique spans many future directions. To name a few, we plan to extend the work to multi-dimensional distributions. We also plan to support such query processing on GPU.
